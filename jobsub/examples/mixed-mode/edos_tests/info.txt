Basically you need the steering for converter, clustering, hitmaker and
aligngbl. The converter is already compatible with EUDAQ2, but pay
attention that it is calling some processors for strips (in clustering
and hitmaker comment out any processor with "strip" from the executed
processors).

Apart from this, the strip detector has ID 11 and you can just delete
it. The FEI4 has ID 7 and it was the second to last plane.

In the config, apart from the various paths, the only modifications
should be:

1) in the converter you change the ID of the FEI4

2) in the hitmaker, you change the vector of residuals. It contains the
residuals of the various planes, in z order. Put 3,-3 for mimosas and
10,-10 for FEI4. Remember to use the new "XXX_pre" gear file after
having run the hitmaker.

3) in aligngbl change the resolution vector similarly to what done with
the residuals in hitmaker ("r" is mimosa resolution, rFEI4 the one of
the FEI4 and dutX and Y of the strip module). For the first tests, I
would use r=0.005 and rFEI4~0.1 for both directions. Leave planes 0 and
5 fixed and Fix XRot, YRot and ZShifts for all the planes, at least for
now. Run first alignGBL usign large cuts (between 0.5 and 1 I would
say), then check the cut plots, and set stricter cuts based on those
plots. This should make the trick to have an OKish first alignment step,
and thus obtain an OK gear.
